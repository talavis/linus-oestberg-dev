# About

I'm originally a life science (bioinformatics) [researcher](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nafzIpQAAAAJ), with a degree and PhD from Karolinska Institutet. I then moved on to working as a system developer (using Python) at Uppsala University/SciLifeLab, and have been involved in the development of e.g. [SweFreq](https://swefreq.nbis.se/), the [Swedish COVID-19 Data Portal (now Pathogens)](https://www.pathogens.se/), and the [SciLifeLab Data Delivery System](https://delivery.scilifelab.se/). During my time at Uppsala University I moved on to Kubernetes operations and developed a strong interest in security. I'm now a Kubernetes consultant at [Conoa AB](https://www.conoa.se/), with a special focus on security in Kubernetes clusters.
